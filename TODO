[+] in ParDim checkArgsList looks redundend and probably has to be deleted
[+] Fill args.listDev. Write a script to fill
[+] Check what will be if Condor fail to create dag file
[+] Think about providing first stage as condor or local. Delete local launch
[+] Check in "$tabOut" of boostDownload.sh last columns to see if there are some
    repetitve values. If there are, then it means that in the file:
    same folder + same relative file _ origName=false.
[+] rewrite MakeCon.sh file, using more options including cores for makeAquasDag.sh
    Condor accept transFiles using comma only.
[-] make a specific error from BDS if there is a segmentation fault. Then I can
    put constraint on_exit in condor file, so that it is repeated untill there
    is another error.
[+] fix errMsg, so that I can input it even if > /dev/null
[+] If no core labels in the file then just ignore them. That is,
    need to create a special error in readArgs, which returns specific value
    if label not found.
[+] Make a right regexpr for awk to fit like following: DONE FOR PARDIM and funclist
    "        ##[       SCRIPT_NO_SPACES   ]##  "
    That is: a lot of possible spaces before, inside and after, but not
    in the name of the script. https://regex101.com
[+] Change isCoreTask for whichCoreTask=<array of numbers>
[+] Read args in file not all of them, but just those which selected
[+] Give a warning for repeated scripts.
[+] Think if I need to change path for scripts for the whole path. (Changed for
    whole path.)
[-] How better to define local for i
[+] Need to rewrite coreTasks for usual tasks, so that everything can be changed
    just provide default scripts. Since the order is already done.
[+] singleMap vs multimap => different execute files
[+] transfer files
[-] for now all scripts accept just 2 parameters, args file and path
    Delete all stuff from makeAquasDag.sh
[+] Check if exeMap.sh exist. Create map array with key = true/false or single/multi
[-] Finsih single map
[-] Finish boostDownload
    Functions used:ErrMsg, ChkEmptyArgs, EchoLine, ReadArgs, ChkUrl

[-] Make split of funcList. Possible solution:
    ChkEmptyArg + ReadArgs + chkExist + chkAvailabToWrite = something about args
    ErrMsg + WarnMsg + any EchoLine = something about Messages
    ChkUrl = add to download
    
[+] Check that jobsDir is in working directory
[+] Change jobsDir in exeMultiMap.sh for $jobsDir/multiMap/${dagName%.*}
[+] Why download/download in boostDownload using exeSingleMap
[+] If condor then in boost download conOut for their makeCon.sh should be run
    with conOut in jobsDir

[+] jodsDir can be in any directories where we can write, except tmp. Condor
does not work there.
[+] Create better post script
[+] ask about error in makeCondor connected with line 56 in exeDownload.sh
[x] Create specific messages with errors in exe of taskScripts and
    collect them usint postScript. Stupid!
[x] Combine single and multimap in one script with argument map to chose
[+] Despite single or multiMap provide file with all input of previous result
[+] Download has to be the first or single task
[+] extension for input file as an argument in makeAquas.dag
[+] line about 800. conFile provide number of cores of peaks and all other multi
    core scripts
[+] make a relResPath to any of pipeline parts => the next part is running from
    that path
[+] add postscript to open files after multimap.
[+] add iterator in multimap to avoid overlapping of tarfiles

[+] In multiMap jobs are run from multimap dir and return also there, thus,
    in scritps have to write an output such that returns in specific directory,
    which is wrong. I should provide tshis derectory. That is,
    transfer output have to have directory structure somehow. Best option is
    dirName/ - tarFile
[-] in makeIsCtlPool.sh condor accepts transOut and transMap. Since they are
    fixed, probably no need to pass them as arguments.
[+] change posEnd in reading input. ALso, try to make code more concise
The connection between dataPath and Download is hardcoded
selectJobListPath is empty in case of pipeline = just Download

[+] exeAquas/makeAquas - add specname as arguments
[+] check that seleJobsList is not empty file
[+] check duplicates in transfering files
[+] multimap. Check if file for specific directory is empty. ??
[+] transFiles in respect of dirname of scirpts

[+] Trimming maybe no need to unzip since it takes too much memory,
    if unzip then increase memory for every file like *5

[-] save output of pre/post scripts
[-] create a continue argument, which continue to run jobs from specific stage
    Need to
[-] in ToTag exe do not save bam and bam.bai files. They take too much space
[-]in README download, readargs, printargs
[+] support of not installed files in ChipseqParDim ot put on hold
[-] Write a script to parse log files to see if Memory, Ram allocation
[-] Difference between finished jobs and still running jobs in MakeReport time detection.
    If still running, then add # in the end of the dateTimeString, to differentiate
    between finished and not jobs


"Be carefull because now JoinToStr leaves spaces between commas. It is necessary
to provide empty arguments. So, should see if condor is ok with having a lot of commas
in transfer Files"

Download has to be the first or single task

If single task if first no need for dataPath or select job list

exeMap scritps transfer conOut* dagFile and jobsDir

Every Dagmaker has to accept exeFile from argslist
