Classes of tasks:

coreTask - tasks, which can be combined with integrTasks. Any of coreTasks
can be before any of integrTask. Elements of this class are executed before
integrTask.
Current implementation: download, preprocess.
All scripts do not have stages, but have options

integrTask - tasks, which can be integrated by user. They cannot be equal to
any element of coreTask.
Current implementation: allignment, peakcaller using spp.
Scripts might have stages and options.

Both coreTask and integrTask have order inside the class.

Scripts for tasks are in coreTaskScript and integrTaskScript. All scripts have 
to read arguments just from args.list. There are 2 possible sections in the
args.list for a script to read arguments:
##[ ParDim.sh ]## and ##[ "$integrTask" ]##.

Checking points in the Main script:
0. Stages eligible and make sense
   a) no support of first or last stages
   b) first stage after the last
1. not just download:
   a) legible outPath
   b) if no selectJobsTabPath =>  inpPath exists? (if yes, then)
      b1) if download => create name for selectJobsTabPath and
      fill it later, once downlaoding is done
      b2) if no download => create name for selectJobsTabPath and
      fill it using inpPath
      
   c) if selectJobsTabPath, then every path in list exists also from b the same
2. Download: availability to write in inpPath.
